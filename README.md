# Welcome Aboard!

What is this project?

A website that eases â€‹the onboarding process for new tech interns.

Jane is a new TechStart intern at Liberty Mutual. She's so excited to spend a day or two setting up her environment and then jump right into developing with her team. However, she finds that onboarding directions can be convoluted and unclear. It takes her a week or two longer than expected, and a lot more stress, before she can start developing.

Enter... Welcome Aboard!

Example user story w/ Welcome Aboard!

Jessica is also a new TechStart intern, but she uses Welcome Aboard! to assist her onboarding experience. Her team lead has set up clear tasks to complete on her dashboard, each having a video and article with directions for setup along with tips from her teach lead. She asks questions in the comment section of each tasks, and also consults LiMu, a Gen AI chatbot, to help her further (it even speaks aloud!). In her free time, she reviews modules of key tech concepts and earns badges. She also views videos on her Demo feed made by senior engineers. She's able to complete all of her tasks in a timely matter, resulting in a perfect environment and less consultation from her lead.

Our development timeline

alt

For this project, we completed an initial wireframe in Figma and then used a plugin to translate it into base code for our site. This accelerated our ideas tenfold because we could focus more on expanding the idea than the nitty gritty of Markup/styling. Then, we coded the LiMu chatbot and adjusted some parts of the layout. Relevant technologies/languages include HTML/CSS/JS, Cloudforge, Git, Github.dev. We pair programmed everything we coded, and worked collaboratively on the wireframe.

Chatbot

alt Clicking on the chatbot icon on the bottom right will redirect you to a new page where one can ask questions and receive a response instantly. Try a "Hi!" or "slack help". The prompt responses are manually inputted but this would not be the case in future iterations!
