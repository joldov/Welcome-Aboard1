# Welcome Aboard!

Welcome Aboard is a website that eases â€‹the onboarding process for new tech interns.

# Motivation behind the project

The onboarding exprience can often take a long time for new employees adjusting to their environment, and even a daunting one for those who are afraid to ask for help from their mentors and tech leads, worrying if they've already asked them too many questions. Welcome Aboard helps in making the onboarding process efficient and gives a space for both experienced engineers and new employees to connect and help each other on technical issues that may arise. 

# Solution 

Its features give freedom for the tech leads to set up clear tasks to complete on the new employees dashboard, customizing each task if needed. Each task is accompanied by a guide and a video with directions for setup along with tips from their tech lead. It is also possible to ask questions in the comment section under each tasks, accompanied by a badge system that verifies if a user has experienced and solved the issue to help the user further. The most imortant feature would be the AI Chatbot LiMu who is able to assist the user at any give time once clicked on the chat icon that is present on each page. Try sending "How are you?" or "slack help"! Lastly, a demo feed is available if one wants to view all of the available tasks and videos posted by experienced engineers. Hence, this project aims to create a perfect environment to efficiently finish onboarding confidently with less consultation from their leads.

# Tools utilized

For this project, I completed an initial wireframe in Figma and then used a plugin to translate it into base code for the website. This accelerated the idea tenfold because I was able to focus more on expanding the idea than the nitty gritty of Markup/styling. Then, I incorporated the LiMu Chatbot and adjusted some parts of the layout, making sure for a smoothy transition with the design of the rest of the website. Relevant technologies/languages include HTML/CSS/JavaScript, Cloudforge, Git, Github.dev, and Locofy.

# Future iterations

In the future, I envision Welcome Aboard expanding to other departments aside from tech (like accounting and HR), outsourcing it to other companies for their onboarding processes, and employing a dynamic database for its users.
